Mostly for learning purposes


The file named 'Sentiment Analysis' contains the use of basic RNN architectures and the use of embedding to improve the model performance. It takes imdb's movie reviews data into use, an inbuilt dataset in keras for sentiment analysis. RNN architectures are great when we are working on texts (sequential data).

Next Word Predictor uses LSTM architecture. A toy dataset (random paragraph) is considered for trial. Embedding technique is used for making the representation of the words of the sentences more dense and capture its semantic meaning
